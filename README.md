  .depth(1)

// Get a specific event type by slug

## Cosmic CMS Integration

This application uses four main content types:

1. **Users** - Host profiles with contact information and availability preferences
2. **Event Types** - Different types of appointments with durations and descriptions
3. **Bookings** - Individual appointment records with attendee information
4. **Settings** - Site-wide configuration including branding and notification settings

The booking system automatically checks availability based on existing bookings and the host's configured working hours. Buffer time between appointments can be configured in the settings.
